# Question-Answering-Machine-with-DL-and-wxPython
The system answers typical questions asked about a club at my university.
The main functionalities I did in this project are:
• building Shallow Neural Networks and comparing the results using a testing dataset
• Data preparation(cleaning and normalization)
• Building a Graphical User Interface for the application with wxPython
